# Rationale for Backlog Ordering
The Outty Product Backlog has been ordered based on three primary engineering principles to ensure a stable development lifecycle.
## 1. Foundation and Security First
Items 01 and 02 (Authentication and Profile Management) are positioned at the top of the backlog. In a social discovery app, user identity is the core dependency. No other feature—matching, swiping, or chatting—can function without a secure user session and a basic profile record in the PostgreSQL database.
## 2. The Data-Logic-UI Pipeline
We have ordered the Adventure Matrix (03) and Location Obfuscation (04) before the Discovery Engine (06).  
•	**Why**: The matching engine cannot calculate compatibility without user-inputted skill levels and activities.  
•	**Safety**: Privacy-focused location handling must be built into the database logic before the discovery engine begins broadcasting "nearby" users to prevent security leaks.
## 3. MoSCoW and Complexity Risk Management
We utilized the MoSCoW method to ensure all "Must-Have" technical infrastructure is completed before moving to "Should-Have" engagement features.  
•	**Algorithm Complexity**: The Matching Algorithm (08) is estimated at 13 points due to its complex weighted sorting. By placing it in the middle of the backlog, the team ensures the basic "Swipe" UI (07) and "Discovery" logic (06) are stable before introducing the most difficult computational logic.  
•	**Value Realization**: Real-time chat (10) and Social Integration (12) are categorized as "Should/Could" have. While they add immense value, they are logically dependent on a "Match" being successfully created by the earlier, high-priority items.
